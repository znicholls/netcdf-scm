    Weights a subset of the globe using latitudes and longitudes (in degrees East)

    Iris' standard behaviour is to include any point whose bounds overlap with
    the given ranges e.g. if the range is (0, 130) then a cell whose bounds were
    (-90, 5) would be included even if its point were -42.5.

    This can be altered with the ``ignore_bounds`` keyword argument to
    ``cube.intersection``. In this case only cells whose points lie within the
    range are included so if the range is (0, 130) then a cell whose bounds were
    (-90, 5) would be excluded if its point were -42.5.

    Here we follow the ``ignore_bounds=True`` behaviour (i.e. only include if
    the point lies within the specified range). If we want to only include the
    cell if the entire box is within a point we're going to need to tweak things.
    Given this isn't available in iris, it seems to be an unusual way to do
    intersection so we haven't implemented it.

    Circular coordinates (longitude) can cross the 0E.

    lower_lat : int or float

    Computes weights for a given cube in a somewhat efficient manner.

    Previously calculated weights are cached so each set of weights is only calculated

    **Adding new weights**

    Additional weights can be added to ``netcdf_scm.weights.weights``. The values in

    ScmCube, CubeWeightCalculator and any additional keyword arguments. The function should

    Where True values are returned, data will be weightsed out (excluded) from any
    calculations. For example, the "World|Northern Hemisphere|Land" weights should be
    True everywhere except for land cells in the Northern Hemisphere.

    These WeightFunc's can be composed together to create more complex functionality.
    For example `multiply_weights(get_weights_for_area(0, -80, 65, 0), "World|Ocean")` will
