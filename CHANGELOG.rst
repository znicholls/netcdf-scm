master
------

- (`#23 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/23>`_) Added ability to handle cubes with invalid calendar (e.g. CMIP6 historical concentrations cubes)
- (`#20 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/20>`_) Added ``CMIP6Input4MIPsCube`` and ``CMIP6OutputCube`` which add compatibility with CMIP6 data

- (`#17 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/17>`_) Update to crunch global and hemispheric means even if land-surface fraction data is missing
- (`#16 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/16>`_) Tidy up experimental crunching script
- (`#15 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/15>`_) Add ability to load from a directory with data that is saved in multiple timeslice files, also adds:

    - adds regular expressions section to development part of docs
