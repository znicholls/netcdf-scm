Changelog
=========

master
------

- (`#44 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/44>`_) Speed up crunching by forcing data to load before applying masks, not each time a mask is applied

v0.7.2
------

- (`#43 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/43>`_) Speed up crunching, in particular remove string parsing to convert cftime to python datetime

v0.7.1
------

- (`#42 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/42>`_) Add ``netcdf-scm-wrangle`` command line interface
- (`#41 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/41>`_) Fixed bug in path handling of ``CMIP6OutputCube``

v0.6.2
------

- (`#39 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/39>`_) Add ``netcdf-scm-crunch`` command line interface

v0.6.1
------

- (`#40 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/40>`_) Upgrade to pyam v0.2.0
- (`#38 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/38>`_) Update to using openscm releases and hence drop Python3.6 support
- (`#37 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/37>`_) Adjusted read in of gregorian with 0 reference to give all data from year 1 back
- (`#35 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/35>`_) Fixed bug which prevented SCMCube from crunching to scm timeseries with default earth radius when areacella cube was missing
- (`#34 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/34>`_) Move to new openscm naming i.e. returning ScmDataFrame rather than OpenSCMDataFrameBase
- (`#32 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/32>`_) Move to returning OpenSCMDataFrameBase rather than pandas DataFrame when crunching to scm format

- (`#29 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/29>`_) Put crunching script into formal testsuite which confirms results against KNMI data available `here <https://climexp.knmi.nl/cmip5_indices.cgi?id=someone@somewhere>`_, however no docs or formal example until `#6 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/issues/6>`_ is closed
- (`#28 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/28>`_) Added cmip5 crunching script example, not tested so use with caution until `#6 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/issues/6>`_ is closed

v0.4.3
------

v0.4.1
------

- (`#23 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/23>`_) Added ability to handle cubes with invalid calendar (e.g. CMIP6 historical concentrations cubes)
- (`#20 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/20>`_) Added ``CMIP6Input4MIPsCube`` and ``CMIP6OutputCube`` which add compatibility with CMIP6 data


v0.3.1
------

- (`#17 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/17>`_) Update to crunch global and hemispheric means even if land-surface fraction data is missing
- (`#16 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/16>`_) Tidy up experimental crunching script
- (`#15 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/15>`_) Add ability to load from a directory with data that is saved in multiple timeslice files, also adds:

    - adds regular expressions section to development part of docs
    - adds an example script of how to crunch netCDF files into SCM csvs

- (`#14 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/14>`_) Streamline install process
- (`#13 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/13>`_) Add ``load_from_path`` method to ``SCMCube``
- (`#12 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/12>`_) Update to use output format that is compatible with pyam
- Update ``netcdftime`` to ``cftime`` to track name change
- (`#10 <https://github.com/znicholls/netcdf-scm/pull/10>`_) Add land/ocean and hemisphere splits to ``_get_scm_masks`` outputs
